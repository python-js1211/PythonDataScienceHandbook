# Python Data Science Handbook

Jupyter notebook content for my OReilly book, the
[Python Data Science Handbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do)

See also the free companion project, [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython): a fast-paced introduction to the Python language aimed at researchers and scientists.

This repository will contain the full listing of IPython notebooks used to create the book, including all text and code. I am currently editing these, and will post them as I make my way through. See the content here:

## Code Listings

The notebooks above are still being edited. In the meantime, you can see all
the code from the book in [code_listings](code_listings).
The code is in IPython notebooks, organized by book chapter and section.
All code from this book was tested with Python 3.4-3.5, though it should be
near 100% compatible with Python 2.7 as well.


## Figure Appendix

Nearly every figure used in the book was generated using Matplotlib.
Most figures are generated by the code within the text; those few that are not
can be found in the online-only [Figure Appendix](figure_appendix/06.00-Figure-Code.ipynb)
