# Python Data Science Handbook Supplemental Materials

Supplemental materials for my OReilly project, the
[Python Data Science Handbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do)

![cover image](cover-early-release.jpg)

See also the free companion project, [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython).

This repository will contain the full listing of IPython notebooks used to create the book, including all text and code. I am currently editing these, and will post them as I make my way through. See the content here:

### [Preface](notebooks/00.00-Preface.ipynb) 
### 1. [IPython: Beyond Normal Python](notebooks/01.00-IPython-Beyond-Normal-Python.ipynb)
### 2. Introduction to NumPy *(coming soon)*
### 3. Data Manipulation with Pandas *(coming soon)*
### 4. Visualization with Matplotlib *(coming soon)*
### 5. Machine Learning *(coming soon)*


## Code Listings

Until the notebooks are finished, you can see all the code from the book
in [code_listings](code_listings).
The code is in IPython notebooks, organized by book chapter and section.
All code from this book was tested with Python 3.4-3.5, though it should be
near 100% compatible with Python 2.7 as well.


## Figure Appendix

Nearly every figure used in the book was generated using Matplotlib.
Most figures are generated by the code within the text; those few that are not
can be found in the online-only [Figure Appendix](figure_appendix/06.00-Figure-Code.ipynb)
