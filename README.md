## Code Listings

All the code from the book can be found in [code_listings](code_listings).
The code is in IPython notebooks, organized by book chapter and section.


## Figure Appendix

Nearly every figure used in the book was generated using Matplotlib.
Most figures are generated by the code within the text; those few that are not
can be found in the online-only [Figure Appendix](figure_appendix/06.00-Figure-Code.ipynb)


## Full Notebooks

I am still negotiating with OReilly the open publication of the full manuscript in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Stay tuned!
